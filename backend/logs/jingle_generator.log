Genre: Upbeat Pop, feel-good, slightly tropical.  Tempo: 120 bpm. Key: C Major.

Instrumentation: Primarily acoustic instruments with a modern twist.  Include:

* **(0-5 seconds):**  Bright acoustic guitar arpeggios, light hand percussion (shakers, claves).  Establish a happy, relaxed mood.
* **(5-15 seconds):**  Introduction of ukulele or bright-sounding electric piano melody.  Melody should be catchy and memorable, slightly repetitive.  Maintain the light percussion.
* **(15-25 seconds):**  Build-up section.  Add a bass line (acoustic or synth bass, light and bouncy).  Increase the volume and intensity of the instruments slightly, but keep it light and airy.  Perhaps add a simple synth pad for warmth.
* **(25-30 seconds):**  Outro.  Melody repeats, then fades out with a final strum of the guitar and a light cymbal crash.  Maintain a positive and uplifting feeling.


Overall mood:  Energetic, joyful, and refreshing. Think sunshine, fresh fruit, and active lifestyles.  The music should be clean, crisp, and avoid anything too heavy or dark.  The instrumentation should sound natural and wholesome.

Genre: Upbeat Pop, feel-good, bright, slightly tropical.  Tempo: 120-140 BPM. Key: C Major.

Instrumentation:  Bright acoustic guitar (strumming pattern emphasizing upbeat rhythm), light handclaps on beats 2 and 4,  bright ukulele melody (high register), bouncy bassline (walking bassline), subtle shaker/tambourine for rhythmic texture, and a light, playful synth melody weaving in and out. The synth should have a clean, bright tone, not overly processed or distorted.

Structure:

* **Intro (0-4 seconds):**  Acoustic guitar and bassline establish the tempo and key.  Handclaps enter on the second measure.
* **Verse 1 (4-12 seconds):** Ukulele melody enters, joined by the shaker/tambourine and synth melody.  Focus on a light and cheerful feel.
* **Chorus (12-20 seconds):**  All instruments play together, creating a fuller, more energetic sound. The ukulele melody becomes more prominent.  A slight increase in volume and intensity.
* **Verse 2 (20-28 seconds):** Similar to Verse 1, but perhaps with a slight variation in the ukulele melody.
* **Outro (28-30 seconds):**  A gradual fade out with the acoustic guitar and bassline remaining prominent until the end.

Instrumentation:  Bright acoustic guitar strumming pattern (think Jack Johnson but slightly more energetic),  hand claps on beats 2 and 4, light shaker throughout,  bright, playful ukulele melody in the higher register,  subtle bass line walking up and down the C major scale.  A simple, repetitive synth melody enters around the 8 second mark, adding a touch of sweetness.  A short, uplifting horn stab (trumpet or similar) accents the main melody at the 15 and 25 second mark.  The music should build slightly in energy towards the end of the 30 seconds, then softly fade out.  The overall feel should be positive, energetic, and carefree, with a focus on bright and clean sounds.  Think of a feel-good summery vibe.  Avoid anything too complex or heavy; keep it simple and catchy.

2025-07-20 14:30:44,947 - INFO - Music Prompt:
Genre: Upbeat Pop, slightly tropical/summery feel.  Tempo: 120-140 bpm. Key: C Major.

Instrumentation:  Acoustic guitar (bright, strummed chords), ukulele (light, playful melody), hand claps (throughout), shaker (subtle rhythm), bass line (walking bass, light and bouncy), light synth pads (supporting chords, creating a sense of warmth and airiness).  A short, memorable melody should be the focus.  The arrangement should build slightly in energy towards the middle, then soften again towards the end.  The overall feeling should be optimistic, energetic, and refreshing.  Include a short, memorable melodic hook that repeats subtly throughout.  Consider adding a playful, slightly quirky sound effect (e.g., a soft chime or bell) at the beginning and end.

Krawings, healthy and bright,
Taste the goodness, feeling light!
Happy snacks for every day,
Krawings makes your worries sway!

2025-07-20 15:21:20,419 - INFO - Music Prompt:
Genre: Upbeat Pop, feel-good, bright

Tempo: 120-140 BPM

Instrumentation:  Acoustic guitar (bright, strummed), ukulele (light and playful), handclaps, light percussion (shaker, tambourine), bassline (walking bassline, upbeat and bouncy), synth melody (bright, major key, arpeggiated).

Structure:

* **Intro (0-4 seconds):**  Ukulele and acoustic guitar intro, light and playful.  Handclaps enter on beat 2 of bar 2.
* **Verse 1 (4-12 seconds):**  Bassline enters, synth melody joins,  building slightly in intensity. Percussion (shaker) adds texture.
* **Chorus (12-20 seconds):**  All instruments play together, full and vibrant.  Tempo slightly increases.  Handclaps become more prominent.
* **Verse 2 (20-28 seconds):** Similar to Verse 1, slightly less intense.
* **Outro (28-30 seconds):**  Fade out with ukulele and acoustic guitar, leaving a feeling of lightness and happiness.  Handclaps trail off.


Key:  C Major or G Major


Feel:  Energetic, optimistic, youthful, playful, refreshing.  Think of a sunny day, fresh fruit, and feeling great.  Avoid anything too cheesy or overly saccharine.

Krawings snacks, a healthy treat,
Taste the goodness, can't be beat!
Happy body, happy mind,
The perfect snack, you're sure to find!
